Guess the Number Game in C
The Guess the Number Game is a console-based application developed in C, designed to demonstrate fundamental programming skills. 
The game generates a random number within a predefined range, and players attempt to guess the number based on feedback provided after each guess.

Key Features:

Implements random number generation using the <stdlib.h> and <time.h> libraries.
Includes loops (do - while) for repeated user input and validation.
Provides user-friendly feedback for each guess (e.g., "Larger," "Smaller ," "Correct").
Tracks the total number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.

Applications:
Demonstrates core programming concepts in C, including variables, loops, and conditionals.
Serves as an entry-level project for learning user input handling and basic game logic.
Easily extendable for advanced features like difficulty levels or graphical interfaces.
This project showcases efficient use of C's standard libraries and is ideal for beginners and students enhancing their programming skills.
